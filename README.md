The Rocket Rides Pilot App is a sample iOS app that demonstrates a checkout flow with [Stripe Terminal](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal).

Features of the Rocket Rides Pilot app:

- Automatically reconnects to the last-connected reader, if that reader is available
- Asynchronously displays reader connection status in the application header
- Implements a robust reader UI using two labels: one displaying reader status and another displaying instructions to the customer.
- Manages the payment flow from start to end, giving operators the ability to retry a payment if some part of the payment fails.
- Protects users from running into SDK errors, such as disconnecting the reader while collecting a payment or running multiple of the same operations at once.

### Exploring the Code

`RRTerminalDelegate.swift` is the main link between the Stripe Terminal iOS SDK and the app's UI. This singleton manages discovery state, connection state, and payment state, and implements the `DiscoveryDelegate` and `TerminalDelegate` protocols. The `RRTerminalDelegate` calls methods in `PayCardViewController.swift`, `MapHeaderViewController.swift`, and `ReaderConnectionViewController`, which are the UIViewControllers responsible for displaying payment state, connection state, and discovery state respectively.

> Rocket Rides is a fake ridesharing platform built to demonstrate different parts of the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payments stack. It is not a real product.

> You might also be looking for the rider app, which demoes Stripe Connect, Connect Express, and the Stripe iOS SDK. That's in a different repository: [see it here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-connect-rocketrides).



## Build and Run

We've made it quick to get started with the Rocket Rides Pilot app so you can see Stripe Terminal in action.

> This project is written in Swift and requires Xcode 11.1 or later to build and run. This project uses [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) to install the dependencies. The app is compatible with iOS 13.1+.

**Step 1:** [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register?redirect=%2Fdashboard) if you don't have one; otherwise, [log into your Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fdashboard). You'll need to get your test mode secret key in the next step.

**Step 2:** Deploy the [Example Terminal Backend](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend)

**Step 3:** In this project's directory, install the dependencies using CocoaPods:

```
$ pod install
```

**Step 4:** Open **`rocketrides-pilot.xcworkspace`** â€”**not** rocketrides-pilot.xcodeprojâ€” in Xcode 11.1 or later. 

**Step 5:** Open `APIClient.swift`, then, around line 20, replace the example backend URL with your backend URL from Step 2:

```swift
static let baseURL = URL(string: "<https://example.herokuapp.com>")
```

**Step 6:** Build and run the app in your favorite iPhone simulator. 

<details><summary><strong>Debugging: </strong>If the app stays on the Map screen without loading the trip overview:</summary>
The pilot app needs to be able to detect your current location in order to begin the ride. Sometimes the iOS simulator won't properly find a location, nor will it report that a location can't be found. If this happens, click on Debug &rarr; Location &rarr; Apple in the menu bar to force the simulator to locate itself.
</details>

**Optional Step 7â€”If you have a [BBPOS Chipper 2X BT](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt)**: The Rocket Rides Pilot app uses the [simulated card reader](https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/testing#simulated-reader) by default. If you want to configure the app to discover real card readers, you can change the discover configuration near line 30 of `RRTerminalDelegate.swift`:

```swift
static let config = DiscoveryConfiguration(deviceType: .chipper2X,
                                      discoveryMethod: .bluetoothProximity,
                                            simulated: true) // change to false!
```
